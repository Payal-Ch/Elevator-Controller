# Elevator Controller for 5 Floors

This project implements a Mealy state machine for an elevator system with 5 floors. It uses 3-bit inputs for floor requests and up/down buttons for each floor. The elevator moves between floors based on the button inputs, with the current and next floor states updated accordingly. The design includes VHDL code, simulation waveforms, and test cases to verify functionality.
